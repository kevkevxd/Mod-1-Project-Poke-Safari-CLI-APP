Welcome to Poké Safari!

This a CLI App made by Kevin Xie and Ryan Flynn

Poké Safari is a CLI app that emulates the Pokémon Safari Zone minigame. In the app you can sign up, sign in after you sign up, catch pokemon, and look at your PC. 

When catching Pokémon you can either throw a safari ball, throw a rock, throw a piece of bait, or run away. 

The mechanics of rock and bait in the game are based on chance. So depending on the Pokémon's mood a rock or a piece of bait may increase the pokemon's chance to be caught at the cost of a higher chance to flee. If the Pokémon's mood does not match the rock or bait you will not get a higher chance to catch the Pokémon, but you will still suffer the higher chance to flee. This makes the game a little more interesting.

Instructions on How to Play:

1. First fork and clone down the app.
2. Then run a 'bundle install'.
3. Then run 'rake db:migrate' and after that 'rake db:seed' in your terminal.
4. After that run 'ruby bin/run.rb' in your terminal.
5. Now you are ready to play! Follow the menus by using the arrow keys and by pressing enter.



Thanks for playing!
